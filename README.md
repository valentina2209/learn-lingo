Key Features:
Authentication: User registration, login, and logout via Firebase Authentication.

Tutor Catalog: A complete list of tutors with filtering and "Load more" functionality.

Favorites: A private, persistent list of saved tutors for authenticated users.

Booking: A modal form for booking a trial lesson.

‚ú® Core Functionality
Authentication and Data Handling
Forms for Login and Registration are in modals and validated by react-hook-form & yup (all fields mandatory).

Modals close correctly upon X button click, backdrop click, or Esc key press.

Tutor data is sourced from a collection in the Firebase Realtime Database.

Tutor Listing
The Teachers page initially displays 4 cards. Subsequent cards are loaded via a Load more button, triggering an additional database query.

The tutor card includes Read more functionality to expand and show detailed information and student reviews.

The Book trial lesson button opens a validated booking form.

Favorites Management
The "Heart" button's functionality depends on the user's status:

Unauthenticated: Triggers a notification/modal asking the user to log in.

Authenticated: Adds or removes the tutor from the user's favorites list.

The favorited state (heart color) is persistent across page reloads (using localStorage or Firebase).
