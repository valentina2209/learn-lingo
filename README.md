‚ú® Core Features Detailed
1. Authentication and Firebase Integration
Authentication is handled via Firebase Authentication.

Registration and Login forms are displayed within a modal window.

Forms are validated using react-hook-form and yup (all fields are mandatory).

Modals close correctly upon clicking the close button (X), the backdrop, or pressing the Esc key.

Tutor data is stored in the Realtime Database (in the teachers collection).

2. Tutor and Favorites Management
The Teachers page initially renders 4 tutor cards.

The Load more button dynamically fetches the next batch of cards from the database.

Favorites (Heart) ü§ç / ‚ù§Ô∏è:

Unauthenticated user: receives a modal or push notification about the necessity of logging in.

Authenticated user: the card is added to/removed from favorites (state is persisted using localStorage or a dedicated users collection in Firebase).

The "favorited" state is maintained upon page refresh.

3. Details and Booking
The Read more button expands the card to show detailed information about the tutor and student reviews.

The Book trial lesson button opens a modal form for booking a trial session.

The booking form is also implemented with react-hook-form and yup (all fields are mandatory).

The modal has standard closing conditions.
